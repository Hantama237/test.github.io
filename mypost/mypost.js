Maybe you have experienced that when you create react native monorepos using yarn workspaces there is some react native library 
that is become not found especially in expo when you run yarn start there would be error because expo couldn't find the dependency
in the node_modules folder. The poin to make it work is by using nohoist feature of the yarn workspaces. And here is how I create the monorepos :
`+ReactNative.createCodeSection(
`asdasd;asdasd;
    if(a===3){
        asd;
    }
`
))
